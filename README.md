  A pet project on Unity in which the player controls a character who stacks cubes under him and loses them when he collides with obstacles.
  The project implements:
- a starting screen with the text "Tap To Play";
- a losing screen with a button and the text "Try Again";
- a text that "flies out" when stacking a new cube;
- a trail from the first cube sliding on the ground;
- moving the character forward and controlling it;
- stacking cubes under the player;
- loss of cubes when colliding with obstacles;
- infinite level generation.
  Additionally, added camera shaking when colliding with obstacles, the effect of stacking a new cube, and the implementation of ragdoll.
